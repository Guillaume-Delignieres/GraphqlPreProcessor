<MudText Class="mb-8">This will test app allow to demonstrate the stripping of a GraphQL file content for a selected operation</MudText>

<br />
<MudText Typo="Typo.h5" GutterBottom="true">Information about this application</MudText>
<br />
<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    This application will let you strip the unecessary content of a GraphQL file after an operation has been selected.<br />
    The code for the pre processor is accessible directly on <MudLink Href="https://github.com/Guillaume-Delignieres/GraphqlPreProcessor/blob/master/GraphQl/GraphQlPreprocessor.cs">GitHub</MudLink>.<br/><br />
    
    This app will first parse the content of the GraphQL file to find the operations that can be extracted. To validate that the content is an actual valid graphQL, I am using <MudLink Href="https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/parser">GraphQL Parser for dotnet</MudLink>.
    It makes sure that the content is valid. I am not using regex to do so as it would be far too complicated<br/><br />
    
    After having selected the operation, it will extract the operation and it's attached fragments.<br/><br />

<MudAlert Severity="Severity.Info"> There are a lot of enhancement that can be done to this app ! Decoupling the information displayed in the page to a separate <i>Model</i> for example</MudAlert>
